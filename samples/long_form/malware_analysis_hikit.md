## Summary

> This may be the only piece consumers read so cover the key findings  

HIKIT is a later stage remote access trojan (RAT) used by GLASS WIZARD on comprimsed high value targets. What makes HIKIT unique is unlike early stage implants (such as Poison Ivy) that are used on victim organization client systems (employee endpoints) HIKIT is deployed on Internet facing services. Instead of using a callback beacon, as is used in Poison Ivy, the attacker accesses HIKIT as a server via a trigger, then uses it for a variety of uses including proxying into the victim network

## Basic Dynamic Analysis

> Input from an automated sandbox

N/A. Using information from 3rd party report.

## Behavioral Characteristics

> Descriptions of how the malware accomplishes it's major goals, based on kill chain methods

- Acts as a remote access trojan including:
	- shell: Allows remote shell access to the victim system
	- file: Gives direct filesystem access
	- connect: Establishes a port forwarded connection
	- socks5: Forwards proxy traffic
	- exit: ends channel
- Recieves HTTP request from outside host (malware acts as service) by intercepting network traffic.

### Delivery Mechanisms:

> How the malware got to the victim system

- Second stage tool, delivered via adversary upload to target host.

### Persistence Mechanisms:

> How the malware runs at startup and continues running

- Runs as a service on the compromised host.

### Spreading Mechanisms:

> How the malware migrates between systems

- Manual. Attacker may proxy through an infected host in spreading. 

### Exfiltration Mechanisms:

> How the malware uses to move data outside the victim network

- File exfiltration may take place via `file` command. 

### Command and Control Mechanisms:

> How the malware is given tasking by the attacker

- Attacker access the victim host via direct network connection (IE host must be internet facing). 
- Attacker uses the `/password` path.

## Dependencies

> System level requirements for the malware to execute

### Supported Operating Systems:
- Microsoft Windows operating system (versions unknown)
- Imports from the following system files
	- ADVAPI32.dll
	- KERNEL32.dll
	- ole32.dll
	- SETUPAPI.dll
	- SHLWAPI.dll
	- USER32.dll
	- WS2_32.dll

### Required Files:
- Driver file that allows network access: `%TEMP%\w7fw.sys`

### Second Stage Downloads:
- N/A (this is a second stage kit) 

### Registry Keys:
- Unknown 

## Detection

> Unenriched information from the sample useful for identifying infections.

### Network Indicators of Compromise

> Network strings, domains, URLs, tls certificates, IPv4, IPv6 Addresses, etc.

- N/A at this time (as this is a server component) 

### File System Indicators of Compromise

> File strings, file paths, signing certificates, registery keys, mutexts, etc.

- "YNK Japan Inc." code signing certificate.
- See strings & hashes above.

## Response Recommendations

> Incident response centric steps for pausing and removing the malware.

### Mitigation Steps:
- Disrupt internet facing network access for an infected system.
- Secondary: Block internal network access to avoid the attacker using an interna proxy.

### Eradication Steps:
- Because tool is installed by adversary manually a full rebuild of infected system is recommended.
